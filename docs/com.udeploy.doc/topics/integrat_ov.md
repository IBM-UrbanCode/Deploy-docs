# Overview of integrations

HCL® UrbanCode™ Deploy supports integrations with other IBM® products, products from others, and certain cloud systems.

HCL UrbanCode Deploy integrates with IBM UrbanCode Release so that you can manage the release of complex interdependent applications. See [Integrating with HCL UrbanCode Deploy](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS4GCC_6.1.1/com.urelease.doc/topics/installIntegrate_udeploy.html).

Most integrations with HCL UrbanCode Deploy are accomplished by using plug-ins. Plug-ins provide tools for creating component processes and integrations.

See the following page on IBM developerWorks® for information about plug-ins that support other products: [UrbanCode Deploy Plug-ins](https://developer.ibm.com/urbancode/plugins/ibm-urbancode-deploy).

-   **[Connecting to clouds through HCL UrbanCode Deploy](../topics/cloud_integrate_vsp_ov.md)**  
The HCL UrbanCode Deploy server can use virtual system patterns from cloud systems such as IBM Cloud Orchestrator to create dynamic environments.
-   **[Configuring virtual system pattern-based clouds](../../com.udeploy.install.doc/topics/cloud_configure.md)**  
To create dynamic environments on a cloud system that uses virtual system patterns, you must install a script package on your cloud system.
-   **[Integrating with IBM Rational Asset Manager](../topics/ramintegrat_cpt.md)**  
You can use IBM Rational® Asset Manager to store and catalog build outputs, test results, and related packages as part of component processes in HCL UrbanCode Deploy.
-   **[Integrating with IBM Rational Test Workbench](../topics/rtwintegrat_cpt.md)**  
You can use IBM Rational® Test Workbench to virtualize services and to run integration tests as part of component processes in HCL UrbanCode Deploy.
-   **[Integrating with cloud and mobile services with IBM Bluemix DevOps Connect](../topics/installIntegrate_UCR_cloud_cp.md)**  
IBM Bluemix DevOps Connect coordinates communication between IBM UrbanCode Release, HCL UrbanCode Deploy, and the IBM Cloud and Bluemix services.
-   **[Provisioning environments through the server \(through virtual system patterns\)](../topics/env_provision_vsp.md)**  
You can provision environments on a cloud system as part of creating an application environment on the HCL UrbanCode Deploy server.
-   **[z/OS considerations for UrbanCode Deploy](../topics/zos_ch.md)**  
UrbanCode Deploy includes support for the z/OS platform. Although the articles in this Knowledge Center for using UrbanCode Deploy to deploy applications, certain platform-specific configuration factors must be considered when using a z/OS model.
