# Process steps: Reference

Application processes, component processes, and generic processes are created with the process editor.

HCL® UrbanCode™ Deploy provides several common process steps. Otherwise, application processes are assembled from processes that are defined for their associated components. Application processes, like component processes, are created with the process editor.

The following process steps are provided by the server. For information about steps that are provided by plug-ins, see the documentation for the individual plug-in on IBM® developerWorks®: [IBM UrbanCode™ Deploy Plug-ins](https://developer.ibm.com/urbancode/plugins/ibm-urbancode-deploy).
