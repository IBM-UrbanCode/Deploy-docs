# License management

HCL® UrbanCode™ Deploy provides a 60-day license-free evaluation period. To use all product features after the evaluation period, you must have a license.

After the evaluation period, you can access HCL UrbanCode Deploy to view and edit items but you cannot run deployments. You can apply a license at any time.

-   **[License scenarios](../../com.udeploy.install.doc/topics/license_scenarios.md)**  
After the evaluation period, you must acquire a license before you can use all product features. Several different license scenarios are available. Depending on the scenario, you might need to apply licenses to HCL UrbanCode Deploy servers, agents, or both.
-   **[Mixed mode licensing](../topics/mixed_mode_licensing.md)**  
Mixed Mode Licensing gives you the ability to use both Authorized Agent licenses and Floating licenses on the same UrbanCode instance for greater flexibility.
-   **[Applying licenses to servers and agents](../../com.udeploy.install.doc/topics/license_apply.md)**  
To use licenses, you install a Rational® Common Licensing server, import your license keys, and link the HCL UrbanCode Deploy servers or agents to the license server.
-   **[Tracking agent usage](../topics/license_agentTracking.md)**  
You can track daily agent usage. Agent usage can provide a rough estimate of agent license use.
