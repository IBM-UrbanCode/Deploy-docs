<h3>GDPR</h3>
<p>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has been adopted by the European Union (&quot;EU&quot;) and applies from May 25, 2018.</p>
<h4>Why is GDPR important?</h4>
<p>GDPR establishes a stronger data protection regulatory framework for processing of personal data of individuals. GDPR brings:</p>
<ul>
<li>New and enhanced rights for individuals</li>
<li>Widened definition of personal data</li>
<li>New obligations for processors</li>
<li>Potential for significant financial penalties for non-compliance</li>
<li>Compulsory data breach notification</li>
</ul>

<h3>Product Configuration - Considerations for GDPR Readiness</h3>
<p>The following sections provide considerations for configuring UrbanCode Velocity to help your organization with GDPR readiness.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Data Life Cycle</h3>
<h4>What is the end-to-end process through which personal data go through when using our offering?</h4>
<p>IBM UrbanCode Velocity (UCV) uses a client-server model. The server provides
the web-based front-end and core services, such as workflow and security. Services can be consumed by clients and other services. Deployments are orchestrated by the server and, when integrated with UrbanCode Deploy, performed by agents distributed throughout the network. Clients access the server through web browsers, the REST API, or the command-line client.</p>
<p>The core installation of UCV includes a server, database, and a license server.</p>
<p>There are several third-party products that interact with UCV via plug-ins, and might exchange data. Some of these are IBM-owned, and many others are provided by other technology suppliers. The <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSCKX6_1.0.0/com.ibm.insights.doc/topics/c_install_requirements.html">UCV system requirements</a> provides information the requirements for the associated software. For considerations for GDPR readiness of a third-party product, see that product’s documentation.</p>
<h4>What types of data flow through UCV?</h4>
<p>As a software deployment an integration engine, UCV does not require sensitive personal data to be gathered from the client or the client's clients.</p>

<h3>Data Storage</h3>
<p>Deployments are orchestrated by the server and performed by agents distributed throughout the network. The file store, CodeStation, contains log files, artifacts, and other non-structured data objects. Reporting tools can connect directly to the relational database.</p>
<p>The file store manages artifacts in a secure and and tamper-proof repository that ensures deployed artifacts are identical to
those tested in preproduction environments.</p>

<h4>Protection</h4>
<p>UCV uses several technologies to provide security. Some features can be configured to meet client requirements such as Transport Layer Security (TLS). Some features are disabled by default, such as mutual authentication.</p>

<h3>Data Access</h3>
<p>The UCV team- and role-based security system manages user interactions and secures product features.
Roles control virtually every product area, including the objects that users can create and who can
modify the security system itself. User-created objects are managed by teams. Team members can only access objects, such as applications,
managed by their team. Team members interact with team-managed objects according to the permissions granted to their role.</p>

<h4>Logging administration activity:</h4>
<p>Administrative activity is kept in the system logs. instances when the admin user adds a user or changes a users role and permissions are tracked in the log.</p>

<h3>Data Processing</h3>
<p>Users control the way in which UCV interacts with data passing through it by their definition of task and application processes. A process is commonly constructed by a user acting in the role of “developer” working with the component plug-in toolkit. A process is composed of discrete building blocks (known as steps) that are joined together by the developer.</p>
<h4>Who has access to the Data?</h4>
<p>Most customers import users from external LDAP realms. Clients filter LDAP account data for the information they need, such as user IDs, email addresses, and passwords. Groups that the imported users belong to are also
imported.</p>
<p>Permissions are assigned to roles and users and groups are placed into roles when they are placed onto teams. Users without roles have read-only privileges and cannot access data let alone modify it.</p>
<h4>Encryption:</h4>
<p>Communication between server and clients or external systems and can be
secured by using SSL and TLS, with optional mutual key-based authentication for each end-point. This communication
protocol is stateless and resilient to network outages.</p>

<h3>Data Monitoring</h3>
<p>With an external monitoring tools, clients can use Managed Beans (MBeans) to review numerous details about UCV, such as statistics that specify how many tasks are available or see how long it takes for an deployment to run to completion. Clients can use these statistics and details to assess the health of their deployments and deployment processes.</p>
<h4>Activity monitoring</h4>
<p>Audit and diagnostic logs are under user control. Clients control the amount of user activity maintained and the frequency with which it is stored.</p>
